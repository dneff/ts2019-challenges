# Chaos Engineering

In 2017, 98% of organizations said a single hour of outage would cost their business over $100,000. The CEO of British Airways stated how one failure that stranded tens of thousands of British Airways passengers in May 2017 cost the company 80 million pounds ($102.19 million USD).

Chaos Engineering is **preventive medicine**. It identifies failures before they become outages. You literally break things on purpose to learn how to build more resilient systems. By proactively testing, you can identify and fix failures before they end up in the news.
