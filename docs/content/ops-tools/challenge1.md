Challenge 1

Start environment

```
./start.sh
```

Login to the server

```
./login.sh
```

Get webserver version using `nmap` tool.

 Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering.

 Webserver is running on localhost.

 Hint: run `nmap` without arguments for help


Your code will be seen in the output of `nmap` command. Use only version number without webserver name
