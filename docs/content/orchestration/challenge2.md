Challenge 2 - Remote Execution

### Start environment, and bring up salt master and minions 

```
ssh devops
cd /vagrant/challanges/devops/orchestration
./setup.sh
```

## Install missing Package using salt cmd.run

### 1. Determine the os details of the servers running in salt stack

```
kubectl exec smaster-0 -- salt \* cmd.run "cat /etc/hosts"
```

#### 2. Find out a package  name "lighttpd" whether it is installed across all the servers

```
kubectl exec smaster-0 -- salt \* cmd.run "dpkg -l lighttpd"
```

The above command should provide information about package details if it is already installed.

#### 3. Install the package on sminion-0  

```
kubectl exec sminion-0 -- bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y lighttpd"
```


Ensure that there should not be any error returned in the output. 

#### 4. Validate again for consistent state across all the minions

```
kubectl exec smaster-0 -- salt \* cmd.run "dpkg -l lighttpd"
```


#### 5. Your key will be combination of string written below and lighttpd version (major.minor.patch)

```
ev19orchestration<version as major.minor.patch>
```

yay! You have reached the end of this Challenge. To recap this challange we learnt about how Salt lets you remotely execute shell commands across multiple systems using cmd.run. To explore a little further there are also multiple execution function which can be used which can further abstract the limitation of os specific commands. See https://docs.saltstack.com/en/getstarted/ssh/remotex.html for few more such examples.
